# 1. Introduction

## Introduction(high level)
- **Motivation.** At a high level, what is the problem are you/the authors are working in and why is it important?

Sometimes it is important to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?


## Introduction(low level)
- **Motivation.** What is the specific problem considered in this work? This slides narrows down the topic area of the current work. 
  
In the first slide you have established general context and importance.       

Here you establish specific context and background.

- Problem 1 :
- Problem 2 :
- …

(It is fine to have only one problem)



## Literature and Existing Efforts
- At a high level what are the existing works to tackle the problems mentioned in your Slide 2. 

Summarize the most relevant works, better follow a story line (what are their relations? one improve another?) 




## Limitations of Existing Works

- You need to discuss the limitations of these existing approaches at a high level. 



These limitations are very useful and will be used in order to introduce the solution in the next slides to talk its novelty compared to other work in the area.

- Limitation 1:
- Limitation 2:
- …


(It is fine to have only one limitation)



# 2. This Paper
some words


## The Paper's High-Level Idea/Key Observation/Insight/Objective/…



- This slide will express your/the authors' idea in general way by addressing the limitations of the previous works in your previous slide. What is the general approach taken? Or what are the key observation/insight, ..



(It is fine to talk about only one item)



## Challenges


- You discuss the challenges to develop the solution. Why it is difficult and hard for existing literatures.
  - Challenge 1: 
  - ...


(It is fine to talk about only one challenge)



## Design and Implementation


- Introduce the phases/steps/components of the proposed framework with an illustrative figure here.
  - Component 1:
  - Component 2:
  - Component 3:



## Design and Implementation



- Introduce and describe each components of the approach with illustrative examples.



## Design and Implementation (cont)


- ...



# 3. Evaluation
some words

## Evaluation

- Experimental Set Up
  - How did you collect your data and prepare your benchmark?
  - What platform did you implement your approach?


- Evaluation Methodology
  - What are the baselines or competitors?
  - What are the research questions? 


# 4. Summary
some words

1. Summary the contributions (and limitations)
