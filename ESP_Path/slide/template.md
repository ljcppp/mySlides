## Introduction(high level)

</br>

- **Motivation.** At a high level, what is the problem are you/the authors are working in and why is it important?

</br>

Sometimes it is important to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?

<!--v-->

## Introduction(low level)

</br>

- **Motivation.** What is the specific problem considered in this work? This slides narrows down the topic area of the current work. 

</br>

In the first slide you have established general context and importance.       

Here you establish specific context and background.

- Problem 1 :
- Problem 2 :
- …

(It is fine to have only one problem)

<!--v-->

## Literature and Existing Efforts

</br>

- At a high level what are the existing works to tackle the problems mentioned in your Slide 2. 

</br>

Summarize the most relevant works, better follow a story line (what are their relations? one improve another?) 

<!--v-->

## Limitations of Existing Works

</br>

- You need to discuss the limitations of these existing approaches at a high level. 

</br>

These limitations are very useful and will be used in order to introduce the solution in the next slides to talk its novelty compared to other work in the area.

- Limitation 1:
- Limitation 2:
- …


(It is fine to have only one limitation)
